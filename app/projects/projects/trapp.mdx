Trapp is a SHELL based job application tracker with in-built automation using Slenium and support for application portal links from LinkedIn, Handshake, and Greenhouse. Being a SHELL script with a simple Python backend, Trapp is incredibly lightweight. The tracker uses the frontend integration testing library Selenium to automate scraping and extracting information specific to any given job posting.
